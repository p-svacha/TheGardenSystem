FEATURE ROADMAP (not necessarily in that order, just things i plan to implement)

shed:
	each garden sector has a shed, a permanent object with special tier
	shed can be clicked on to open, showing the sectors inventory

ordered scatter:
	instead of full scatter all at once, objects get scattered one by one with slight delay in between
	this will also make merging nicer (see next chapter)
	add a little jingle, particles, shake or effect when an effect triggers

resource giving animations:
	confirming scatter shows tiles giving resources one-by-one with little animation of resources moving the their ui element

game phase terminology:
	change time ui to show part of day, weekday, week num, month, (year)
	part of day is according to game state
		morning: empty garden, useful to inspect or buy new tiles
		noon: the scatter happens, with one-by-one animation out of the shed, no player input
		afternoon: scatter can be inspected and maybe manipulated
		evening: the harvest happens, each tile gives the resources it produces with little animation one-by-one, no player input
		night: end-of-day windows appear, like order delivery selection, object draft, research draft, etc.

rework town mandates to be more dynamic:	
	include list of months they can appear
	change resources to weight table
		so i.e. "winter supplies" requires 0.6 kindle, 0.4 food
		in january that would be 12 kindle, 8 food = 20 total
		in march 36 kindle, 24 food, = 60 total etc
		total is always month * 20

mergeable objects:
	some tiles have the tag "mergeable".
	if 3 mergeable objects of the same type are next to each other, they turn into a new bigger version (of 1 increased tier) on the middle tile of the 3
	i.e. 3 carrots turn into "carrot patch" that gives +2 food (i know this technically loses 1 food vs 3 carrots, but the save on space is a big advantage)
	merging happens during scatter, and other objects can occupy the 2 tiles that become free through the merging

[maybe] resource progression:
	not all resources are active from the start
	only get added once first time produced or ordered
	only active get shown in resource panel and remaining res

order level increases:
	at the end of week, x customers increase their order level, where x equals current month

new customer draft:
	one new customer is drafted at the end of each month
	additionally, a random customer is added at the end of week 1
	else customer levels are just upgraded

fiber:
	make a customer buying fiber

tooltip improvement:
	add a new "info text" element to tooltip in top right corner
	use it to display the type of thing that is displayed in the tooltip, i.e:
		"rare object" for objects
		"market resource" for resources
		"terrain" for terrian

affection arrows in production overlays:
	when a production overlay is active, also show moving animated arrows where one object affects the production of another
	the more the affection, the fast/bigger the arrow
	arrow like this: > > > > >
	maybe for ProductionModifiersource, aditionally the coordinate is needed from where the effect originates from
	use ^ ^ ^ on tile if source is from same tile

[maybe] obstacles:
	some tiles may have obstacles on them
	to start, just take a rock
	objects will not be scattered on tiles with obstacles on them, until they are removed
	obstacles have HP
	objects can reduce obstacle hp
	i.e. object "Pickaxe" removes 1 hp from all adjacent rocks
	when reaching 0 hp, obstacle is removed
	technically, obstacles are also just objects, but with the "permanent" tag and no effect
		objects with the "permanent" tag do not get removed at the end of the day

conceptDefs:
	concept defs that can be referenced in tooltips to explain mechanics
	- native production
	- market resources
	- abstract resources

modifier apply feedback:
	sound or animation when a modifier is applied

new content:
	add several customers for variety
	add several new objects

game over:
	real game over screen with stats

[maybe] prestige orders:
	additional optional prestige orders may appear
	these do not lose the game if not completed
	but they give an extra reward if completed (draft of rare or epic object, research points, free expansion)

game over logic:
	if an order can't be completed, the customer will expect NOT the resources of that missed order on top of the expected resources of the next week, but you will not get payment for that order
		add this as a note somehwere

ui improvements:
	use more bullet points like in object tooltip
		centralize color and ascii thing for easy use
		use in terrain for "turns into x at y fertility"
		use in object draft effect section, left attached
	in tag tooltip, show owned objects of that tag (grouped by sector)
	show object tier in tooltip
	show resource type in resource tooltip
	when selecting object, show amound of currently owned
	in object draft, make more space for effects
	in shop, objects should be bigger
	in shop, discount indicator should be clearer

sectors (maybe 'plots'):
	instead of having one centralized inventory, where the objects get scattered randomly across the whole garden, the garden can be split in sectors
	sectors are a defined area within your garden
	the inventory is grouped by sector, meaning each object is assigned to one specific sector
	the objects will only be spread within their particular sector
	at the start of the game there will only be one sector with your whole garden
	i feel like this is a necessary and interesting concept to make strategic depth possible in the later stages of the game, so you can focus different sectors for different combos in parallel
	acquring new sectors is a natural reward in very long intervals, but can also be a reward from prestige orders
	when acquiring a new sector, an existing one can be split along the vertical or horizontal axis, all objects of the split sector can be assigned freely to the two new resulting sectors
	this means that sectors will always be rectangular, making it visually clear
	after that, moving objects between sectors isn't free (still need to decide how to do it, maybe with a new general or specialized currency)
	when drafting objects, you draft for a specific sector (sectors get iterated through each day)
	[maybe] each sector has a 'shed', a permanent object with no effects, but that is used to check that sectors inventory.
		Starting sector would have one shed in the middle. Would be elegant way to display inventory without it being just a ui menu you open.

[maybe] research:
	a research tree is added, with modular dependencies between the research projects (like rimworld for example)
	whenever a research project is finished, you can choose a new one from X (starts at 2) random available options
	objects can now additionally give research points, an abstract resource that is needed to complete research projects
	ObjectDef get a new optional research requirement field with a research def
	some ideas of what techs could do
		unlock a new object or set of objects, that can then be drafted
		general bonus to a particular tag, or resource production (inlcuding abstract)
		allowing to see upcoming orders further in advance
		new mechanics (probably also just a set of objects), like i.e. shovels that can dig out treasures / loot boxes
	still todo: overthing terminology. maybe "research" and "techs" doesn't rly fit the theme
	important design considerations:
		techs should mostly not give "general" or plain stat bonuses, but rather amplify specific strategies or help in specific situations
	ideas for specific researches
		- unlock shop (buying res only)
		- unlock selling resources in shop
		- unlock buy objects in shop
		- more and better shop discounts (+1 obj, +1 res, higher discount)
		- you get an additional option when drafting an object (3 -> 4)
		- you get an additional option when drafting a customer (2 -> 3)
		- you get an additional option when drafting a customer (3 -> 4)
		- you get an additional option when drafting a tech to research (2 -> 3)
		- you get an additional option when drafting a tech to research (3 -> 4)
		- Unlock plots and lets you split your garden into 2 plots
		- Unlock a 3rd plot
		- Unlock a 4th plot
		- Unlock a 5th plot
		- fertilization objects
		- food specialization objects
		- herbs specialization objects
		- ornaments specialization objects
		- kindle specialization objects
		- fiber specialization objects
		- obstacle removal objects
		- relations: still get some amount for failed orders
		- relations: get additional money if haven't failed order 3 times in a row for customer
		- mechanic and resource to remove specific objects from inventory
		- mechanic to merge objects
		- mechanic and resource to "expand" option - doesn't replace original options like in a replace, but rather adds 3 additional options
		- general +10% produced for specific resource (applied at end)
		- mechanic to make objects permanent
		- mechanic to get higher tier items in draft than usual (like +5% chance of rare items in end of day draft)
		- mechanic to pay currency for failed delivered order to make it count not as missed
		- see "bossfight" orders an additional month in advance (1->2)
		- new resource trading mechanic where you can trade one resource for another at reduced efficiency
			- then additional research to improve trading
		- complex resources that are "crafted" from basic resources (i.e. object with -1 food, -1 herbs, +1 premium food)
		- mechanic and resource to change town mandate. When used, you get a new option and can choose to stick to the old mandate or take the new one
