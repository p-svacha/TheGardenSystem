FEATURE ROADMAP (in that order)

end of week:
	x customers increase their order level (x is based on week)
	one new customer is drafted every n'th week
	rare item discover

obstacles:
	some tiles may have obstacles on them
	to start, just take a rock
	objects will not be scattered on tiles with obstacles on them, until they are removed
	obstacles have HP
	objects can reduce obstacle hp
	i.e. object "Pickaxe" removes 1 hp from all adjacent rocks
	when reaching 0 hp, obstacle is removed
	technically, obstacles are also just objects, but with the "permanent" tag and no effect
		objects with the "permanent" tag do not get removed at the end of the day

new content:
	add third market resource for order variety
	add several customers for variety
	add several new objects

ordered scatter:
	instead of full scatter all at once, objects get scattered one by one with slight delay in between
	this will also make merging nicer (see next chapter)

mergeable objects:
	some tiles have the tag "mergeable".
	if 3 mergeable objects of the same type are next to each other, they turn into a new bigger version (of 1 increaed rarity) on the middle tile of the 3
	i.e. 3 carrots turn into "carrot patch" that gives +2 food (i know this technically loses 1 food vs 3 carrots, but the save on space is a big advantage)
	merging happens during scatter, and other objects can occupy the 2 tiles that become free through the merging

prestige orders:
	additional optional prestige orders may appear
	these do not lose the game if not completed
	but they give an extra reward if completed (draft of rare or epic object, research points, free expansion)

game over logic:
	instead of immediately losing the game upon one failed ordinary order, you only loose when you can't complete a particular customers order for 2 weeks in a row
	if you can't complete all orders in a week, a new menu appears where you can select which orders you want to complete
	if an order can't be completed, the customer will expect the resources of that missed order on top of the expected resources of the next week

"bossfight" orders:
	unique one-time orders in fixed intervals (every month/4 weeks)
	failing loses the game
	can be seen from start of the month

sectors (maybe 'plots'):
	instead of having one centralized inventory, where the objects get scattered randomly across the whole garden, the garden can be split in sectors
	sectors are a defined area within your garden
	the inventory is grouped by sector, meaning each object is assigned to one specific sector
	the objects will only be spread within their particular sector
	at the start of the game there will only be one sector with your whole garden
	i feel like this is a necessary and interesting concept to make strategic depth possible in the later stages of the game, so you can focus different sectors for different combos in parallel
	acquring new sectors is a natural reward in very long intervals, but can also be a reward from prestige orders
	when acquiring a new sector, an existing one can be split along the vertical or horizontal axis, all objects of the split sector can be assigned freely to the two new resulting sectors
	this means that sectors will always be rectangular, making it visually clear
	after that, moving objects between sectors isn't free (still need to decide how to do it, maybe with a new general or specialized currency)
	when drafting objects, you draft for a specific sector (sectors get iterated through each day)
	[maybe] each sector has a 'shed', a permanent object with no effects, but that is used to check that sectors inventory.
		Starting sector would have one shed in the middle. Would be elegant way to display inventory without it being just a ui menu you open.


[maybe] research:
	a research tree is added, with modular dependencies between the research projects (like rimworld for example)
	whenever a research project is finished, you can choose a new one from 3 random available options
	objects can now additionally give research points, an abstract resource that is needed to complete research projects
	some ideas of what techs could do
		unlock a new object or set of objects, that can then be drafted
		general bonus to a particular tag, or resource production (inlcuding abstract)
		allowing to see upcoming orders further in advance
		discount on orders (i.e. customers expect 5% less X)
		new mechanics (probably also just a set of objects), like i.e. shovels that can dig out treasures / loot boxes
	still todo: overthing terminology. maybe "research" and "techs" doesn't rly fit the theme
