Each day works the same:

morning:	empty garden, new tiles can be bought, shop can be used. useful to inspect terrain and garden
noon:		the scatter happens, with one-by-one animation out of the shed, no player input. The noon ends automatically after the end of the animation.
afternoon:	scatter can be inspected and maybe manipulated
evening:	the harvest happens, each tile gives the resources it produces with little animation one-by-one, no player input. The player ends the evening manually after the animation
night:		end-of-day windows appear, like order delivery selection, object draft, research draft, etc.
