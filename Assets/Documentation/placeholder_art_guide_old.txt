Objects:
- Each object is iconic and isolated, sized to fit on one square tile.
- Sprite is 1024x1024 px in size.
- Background is transparent.
- Objects should have unique silhouettes and high visual contrast.
- Visual metaphors should be clear (e.g. a carrot is unmistakably a carrot).
- Slight exaggeration encouraged for readability.

Resource Icons:
- Each resource icon is iconic and easily readable.
- Sprite is 1024x1024 px in size.
- Background is transparent.
- Objects should have unique silhouettes and high visual contrast.
- Visual metaphors should be clear.
- Slight exaggeration encouraged for readability.

Terrain:
- Sprite is 1024x1024 px in size with no transparency.
- Flat-shaded, natural textures — Use minimal shading with soft gradients or gentle noise; avoid harsh highlights or outlines.
- Earthy, muted colors — Favor desaturated browns, greens, and greys that sit quietly under brighter object sprites.
- Soft, organic shapes — Terrain details (like cracks, clumps, or texture) should feel natural and hand-shaped, not geometric or stylized.
- Seamless edge blending — Ensure all terrain tiles are looped or designed to seamlessly tile in all directions.
- No strong borders or high contrast — Avoid comic-style edging or anything that pulls visual attention away from objects.
