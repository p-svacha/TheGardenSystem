General:
- Pixel Art
- 64x64 pixels per tile

Objects:
- Saturation (~80%)
- Bright colors (50%-100%)
- View details
- Not more than 3 shades for details per "area" (i.e. carrot body is one area in orange, and carrot hair is one area in green)
	- Shadows excluded
- Outline 1px (only straight adjacent pixels, not diagonal)
- Outline color same as inside color with ~50% reduces darkness
- Outline everywhere outside object and where objects intersect
	- Exception is when the object should seamlessy touch ground (i.e. semi-buried carrot)
- Light source always top left => shadowy area lower right
- Shadow area is single black overlay with ~20% opacity over shadowed area
