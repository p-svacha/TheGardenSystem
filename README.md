# The Garden System

_The Garden System_ is a turn-based, tilemap-driven inventory management and engine building game originally inspired by **Luck be a Landlord**.

You manage a garden belonging to a rural town and are tasked with producing enough resource to keep up with orders from various customers and the town council.

Each day, a storm scatters a set all of your objects from your inventories randomly across your garden. Objects interact with each other and the terrain based on a flexible tag and modifier system. Use these systems to create unique and strong combos to be able to produce enough resources.

You will also manage different sectors of your garden, where you can freely move your objects in between, to counteract the randomness and prepare the best object combinations.
Expand them by buying new tiles, clear obstacles and strategically build up synergies to optimize your garden over time.

This prototype explores procedural systems, emergent gameplay, and minimal input complexity with high interaction depth.
